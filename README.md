# README Generator

## Description 

This application generates a README markdown file based off the user inputs. The inquirer package is utilized to obtain the user information. Once all the information is collected the application populates a Title, Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, Tests, and License sections. In the current release the user can select from 4 licenses (MIT, GPL-3.0, MPL-2.0, and Apache-2.0). Once the user selects a license a badge will be generated for the license and when clicked it will navigate to the details of the license.
